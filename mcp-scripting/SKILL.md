# MCP scripting

For multi-call MCP work, write ordinary JavaScript with loops, filtering, chaining, fan-out, or other logic between calls. Run that source with `mcpScript`; it is the primary MCP orchestration surface. For a single MCP search, describe, status check, auth action, or tool call, use `mcp` instead.

Write the source naturally, then pass it as `mcpScript`'s `code` argument:

```js
const { items } = await tools.search({ query: "search issues", server: "github" });
const candidate = items[0];
if (!candidate) return { error: "No matching tool" };

const details = await tools.describe({ path: candidate.path });
if (details.error) return details;

const result = await tools.call(details.path, { query: "is:open label:bug" });
if (!result.ok) return result;
emit({ tool: details.path, completed: true });
return result.data;
```

## Workflow

1. Find candidate tools with `await tools.search({ query, server?, limit?, offset? })`.
2. Inspect the exact returned path with `await tools.describe({ path })`.
3. Call it with `tools.call(path, args)`.

Calls resolve to `{ ok: true, data }` or `{ ok: false, error }`; handle failed calls instead of expecting them to stop the script. `emit(value)` adds user-visible output before the final `return` value. `console` output is captured too.

`tools` is a non-enumerable proxy: `Object.keys(tools)` throws. Always use `tools.search` for discovery. When a known flat path is a valid identifier, direct calls such as `tools.github_search_issues(args)` are supported; use bracket syntax for hyphenated names: `tools["server_tool-name"](args)`. `search`, `call`, `describe`, and promise/serialization names (`then`, `catch`, `finally`, `toJSON`, `toString`, `valueOf`) are reserved on the proxy; if a flat path collides with one, call it via `tools.call("exact-path", args)`.

`tools.search` and `tools.describe` are asynchronous and must be awaited. The default script timeout is 30 seconds; the worker is terminated at the deadline, including for infinite loops. Every invocation still uses normal lazy connection, authentication, output guarding, and approval gates. Result details contain a concise `calls` trace with every search, describe, and call operation; each entry includes its query or path, outcome, and duration.

Use plain JavaScript loops and Promise utilities for composition. Fluent helpers such as `tools.find(...).one()`, `tools.parallel(...)`, and `tools.retry(...)` are not provided.

## Conformance Addendum

## When to Use
Write mcpScript JavaScript for discovering, inspecting, and calling MCP tools.

## Inputs and Outputs
- **Input:** the user request, relevant paths/configuration, and any current error or runtime evidence.
- **Output:** the requested result plus a concise record of actual changes and verification evidence.

## Rules and Limitations
- Resolve relative paths from this Skill directory, not from an unspecified working directory.
- Treat recorded paths, versions, hosts, and UI details as potentially stale; current system evidence takes precedence.
- Do not expose credentials or perform destructive changes without explicit authorization.

## Pitfalls
- Do not guess configuration paths or claim success without checking the resulting state.
- Do not execute copied commands or scripts before reviewing their targets and side effects.

## Verification
1. Confirm the intended files, services, or outputs exist in their expected state.
2. Run the most relevant syntax, configuration, build, or runtime check available for this Skill.
3. Report what was changed, what was tested, and any remaining limitation.
